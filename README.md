# User_Membership_Functionality

The goal of this project is to implement a user membership system for an HTML-based website. The functionality enables users to register, verify their email address, login, and manage their profiles. The primary objective is to provide a seamless experience for users to Register and manage their accounts.


# Task Flow:

1) User Registration:
  Users can register on the website by providing necessary details such as username, email, first name, last name, and password. Upon successful registration, the      system generates an activation/verification email and sends it to the user's registered email address.

2) Email Verification:
  When the user receives the activation/verification email, it contains a unique link to verify their email address. Clicking on this link redirects the user to        the website, and the system verifies and activates the user's account.

3) Login:
  Once the user's email is verified and the account is activated, they can log in to their profile.

4) Profile Page:
  After successful login, users are redirected to their profile page. The profile page displays the user's information such as their first name, last name, email       address, username and password(in encrypted ).

5) User Greeting and Dropdown Menu:
  After login, a personalized greeting is displayed on the website, saying "Hi USERNAME," where "USERNAME" is replaced with the user's actual username. A dropdown    menu with options such as "Edit Profile" and "Logout" is also available, allowing users to manage their profile or log out. By using "Edit Profile" option user 
  can edit their first name, last name, email address, and password. Username will be not editable.  

6) Logout Functionality:
  When the user clicks on the "Logout" link in the dropdown menu, they are logged out from their account and redirected to the homepage.
